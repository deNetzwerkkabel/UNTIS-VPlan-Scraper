# UNTIS-VPlan-Scraper

UNTIS-VPlan-Fetcher is designed to convert the UNTIS HTML substitution plan into JSON. This is built on NodeJS

## Installation
Download the git and open the folder "untisfetcher" with the command line. Install the modules with "npm install".
Change the link at the end of the "index.js" file to the URL of your substitution plan. Make sure that the split view is not selected here, only the cover plan for today or tomorrow.
Run "node index.js" and at the end get the output in the "vertretungen.json".
